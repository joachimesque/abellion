# 🧑‍🌾 Abellion

Based on [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte). Pretty much all the config files and environment is theirs.

## The technical side

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm i`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
